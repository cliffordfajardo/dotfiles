How the script works.
1. `0001setup-my-new-machine.sh` is the entry point
  - it runs `.002osx.sh` script, which customizes my mac OS settings.
  - it runs `.003brew.sh` script which installs the home brew package manager
  - it runs `.004brew-casket.sh` script which installs the common Mac GUI apps I use.


## TODO

- add alfred settings
- look into xcode installation.
- sync Atom & Sublime Text


### Reminders for self
Don't go crazy with this script, it can't account for everything. At least you don't have to manually do much.
- install 1password
- install Kiwi for Gmail
